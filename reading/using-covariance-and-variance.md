## **üî∑ Variance, Covariance, and Linear Regression: Full Summary**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Variance** üìä  
Variance measures how **spread out** the values of a dataset are. It tells us how much the values of a single variable deviate from the mean.  

**Formula:**  

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}
$$

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Covariance**  
Covariance measures the **relationship** between two variables \(X\) and \(Y\). It tells us **how they move together**:  
- **Positive covariance** ‚Üí when \(X\) increases, \(Y\) also increases (direct relationship).  
- **Negative covariance** ‚Üí when \(X\) increases, \(Y\) decreases (inverse relationship).  
- **Zero covariance** ‚Üí no relationship.  

**Formula:**  

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})}{n}
$$

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How Do We Use Covariance and Variance to Find the Slope?**  
We use the formula:

$$
k = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\text{Var}(X)}
$$

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ How Do We Find the Intercept?**  
Once we have the slope \(k\), we find the intercept \(b\):  

$$
b = \bar{y} - k\bar{x}
$$

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Why Not Just Use "Rise Over Run" on Two Points?**  
You **can** use two points to find the slope:

$$
k = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Linear Regression Formula**  
After calculating **\(k\) and \(b\)**, our equation is:  

$$
y = kx + b
$$

### **üéØ Final Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Variance** shows how spread out \(X\) is.  
‚úÖ **Covariance** shows how \(X\) and \(Y\) are related.  
‚úÖ **Slope** is found by dividing covariance by variance.  
‚úÖ **Intercept** is found using the mean values.  
‚úÖ This method **uses all data points** for a more reliable fit compared to "rise over run" with just two points.
