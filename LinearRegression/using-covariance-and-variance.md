## **üî∑ Variance, Covariance, and Linear Regression: Full Summary**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Variance (\(\text{Var}(X)\))** üìä  
#### **What is it?**  
Variance measures how **spread out** the values of a dataset are. It tells us how much the values of a single variable deviate from the mean.  

#### **Formula:**  

\[
\text{Var}(X) = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}
\]

#### **Breakdown of the Formula:**  
1. Take each value of \(X\) and **subtract the mean** of \(X\) ‚Üí \((x_i - \bar{x})\).  
2. **Square** each difference ‚Üí \((x_i - \bar{x})^2\) (to avoid canceling out negative values).  
3. Sum up all squared differences.  
4. Divide by the number of values **\(n\)** (or \(n-1\) in statistics for an unbiased estimate).  

#### **Why do we use variance?**  
- It **quantifies** how spread out the dataset is.  
- Higher variance ‚Üí values are **more spread out**.  
- Lower variance ‚Üí values are **closer to the mean**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Covariance (\(\text{Cov}(X, Y)\))**  
#### **What is it?**  
Covariance measures the **relationship** between two variables \(X\) and \(Y\). It tells us **how they move together**:  
- **Positive covariance** ‚Üí when \(X\) increases, \(Y\) also increases (direct relationship).  
- **Negative covariance** ‚Üí when \(X\) increases, \(Y\) decreases (inverse relationship).  
- **Zero covariance** ‚Üí no relationship.  

#### **Formula:**  

\[
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})}{n}
\]

#### **Breakdown of the Formula:**  
1. Take each \(X\) and **subtract the mean of \(X\)** ‚Üí \((x_i - \bar{x})\).  
2. Take each \(Y\) and **subtract the mean of \(Y\)** ‚Üí \((y_i - \bar{y})\).  
3. Multiply the two differences: \((x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})\).  
4. Sum up all these products.  
5. Divide by **\(n\)** (or \(n-1\) in statistics).  

#### **Why don‚Äôt we square it like variance?**  
- In variance, we square differences to **avoid negative canceling**.  
- In covariance, we **multiply the differences**, and this already tells us the relationship.  
- **Multiplication naturally preserves the relationship‚Äôs direction** (positive or negative).  

#### **Why do we use covariance?**  
- It tells us if two variables move **together** (positive covariance) or **oppositely** (negative covariance).

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How Do We Use Covariance and Variance to Find the Slope?**  
We use the formula:

\[
k ~~ \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\text{Var}(X)}
\]

#### **Why does this formula give us the slope?**  
- The numerator **(Cov(X, Y))** tells us how **\(X\) and \(Y\) move together**.  
- The denominator **(Var(X))** tells us how **spread out \(X\) is**.  
- Dividing these two gives the **rate of change** of \(Y\) with respect to \(X\) ‚Üí **the slope**!  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ How Do We Find the Intercept?**  
Once we have the slope \(k\), we find the intercept \(b\):  

\[
b = \bar{y} - k \bar{x}
\]

#### **Why does this formula work?**  
- We already know that **for a straight line**, the equation is:  

  \[
  y = kx + b
  \]

- We want to find \(b\), so we substitute the **average values** (\(\bar{x}, \bar{y}\)) as a representative point:  

  \[
  \bar{y} = k\bar{x} + b
  \]

- Solving for \(b\):  

  \[
  b = \bar{y} - k\bar{x}
  \]

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Why Not Just Use "Rise Over Run" on Two Points?**  
You **can** use two points to find the slope:

\[
k = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

#### **So why use covariance and variance?**  
‚úÖ If you pick just **two points**, they might be **outliers** ‚Üí unreliable slope.  
‚úÖ Using **all points** (covariance & variance) **reduces error** and gives a more accurate slope.  

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Linear Regression Formula**  
After calculating **\(k\) and \(b\)**, our equation is:  

\[
y = kx + b
\]

Where:  
- \( k ~~ \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\text{Var}(X)} \) ‚Üí slope  
- \( b = \bar{y} - k\bar{x} \) ‚Üí intercept  

‚úÖ This **minimizes errors** and fits the best possible line to the data!
